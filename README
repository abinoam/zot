    Zot! Communications Server

    http://project.friendika.com

	Zot! represents a major fork of the Friendika project. Currently we are
re-writing major components and reviewing many code assumptions. Lots of
unnecessary stuff is being tossed. The Zot! communication layers have not 
yet been implemented, and will start to show up over the next few weeks as
the infrastructure solidifies. 

	This code does not work or do anything useful at this time. 
It is being provided publicly so that those working on Friendika bug fixes
and patches may also apply them to Zot, where applicable.

	The database schema is also currently under review and automatic updates
are not yet applied. If you install this server, you will need to re-install
it whenever the database changes - which will be frequently for at least the
next few weeks.
