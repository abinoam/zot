Friendika addons/plugins license terms are under the control of the project 
author or authors. 

Developers are free to set their own license terms on addons/plugins as 
standalone works. These license terms apply only to the covered addon or
plugin. 

Addons/plugins may be licensed under copyleft or other license terms. Although 
these projects may require Friendika to operate, no addon or plugin may 
mandate any changes to the Friendika project license.
